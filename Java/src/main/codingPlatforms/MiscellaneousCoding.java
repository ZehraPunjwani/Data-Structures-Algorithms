    /*
        You need to design a Vending Machine which
        Accepts coins of 1,5,10,25 Cents i.e. penny, nickel, dime, and quarter.
        Allow user to select products Coke(25), Pepsi(35), Soda(45)
        Allow user to take refund by canceling the request.
        Return the selected product and remaining change if any
        Allow reset operation for vending machine supplier.

        My implementation of Java Vending Machine has the following classes and interfaces :

        // Solution
        VendingMachine
        It defines the public API of a vending machine, usually, all high-level functionality should go in this class

        VendingMachineImpl
        A sample implementation of Vending Machine

        VendingMachineFactory
        A Factory class to create different kinds of Vending Machine

        Item
        Java Enum to represent Item served by Vending Machine

        Inventory
        Java class to represent an Inventory, used for creating the case and item inventory inside Vending Machine

        Coin
        Another Java Enum to represent Coins supported by Vending Machine

        Bucket
        A parameterized class to hold two objects. It's kind of Pair class.

        NotFullPaidException
        An Exception is thrown by Vending Machine when a user tries to collect an item, without paying the full amount.

        NotSufficientChangeException
        Vending Machine throws this exception to indicate that it doesn't have sufficient change to complete this request.

        SoldOutExcepiton
        Vending Machine throws this exception if the user requests a product that is sold out.
